## Synopsis

What would a Github account be without a Todo List? Well here's mine, done in React JS

To complete this I followed the book "Learining REACT" by Kirupa Chinnathambi.

## Motivation

I'm always itching to learn something new, and REACT was next on my list.


## Technology

To complete this, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the REACT Library. I used Visual Studio Code as my Text Editor.
